## What's The Problem?
>The original code for this website was lacking semantic HTML elements and cluttered CSS code, making the structure and and content importance unclear-- making future updates difficult-- and styling hard to figure out. Also Horiseon being a marketing company, the website wouldn't have appeared in an optimal position in the search engines and those using assistive technologies would have a bad user experience-- bad for business!

## Solution
* Add semantic elements to define page better
* Added alt attribute to images
* Consolidated CSS properties
* Redefined class names to better connect CSS properties
* Restructed HTML & CSS in logical order

## Programs
* Visual Studio Code
* Git Bash
